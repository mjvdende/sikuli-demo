# Sikuli demo
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mjvdende/sikuli-demo.svg?branch=step-01)](https://travis-ci.org/mjvdende/sikuli-demo)

This project aims to provide an example implementation of the [PageObjects](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) pattern for [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/)

# Prerequisites

- SikuliX-1.1.0 installed, goto http://www.sikulix.com/ for detailed installation instructions
- Apple mail. This demo is written for Apple Mail for now. 
I guess the images I provided can be easily swapped for other images using the Sikuli IDE.

# Why Sikuli?

from sikuli.org:
> Sikuli automates anything you see on the screen. 
It uses image recognition to identify and control GUI components. 
It is useful when there is no easy access to a GUI's internal or source code.

# Executing tests

Apple mail should be running in the background.
From your favorite ide or command line build the project.
    
    mvn install

# Development

You can actually use any mail program for this framework. 
Just replace the images that come with this project.
